Participation to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
in PostgreSQL 18, because why not!

Let's see if we can go all the way of this year 12 puzzles
(without using PL/pgSQL or other kind of imperative programming!)

I reserve the right to do some formatting-only pre-treatment on puzzle inputs,
so they can be imported into PostgreSQL tables using COPY FROM commands
(but I'll indicate reproduction steps in comments).
